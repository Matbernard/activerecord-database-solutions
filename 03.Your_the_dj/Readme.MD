## Your are the DJ

It is your sister's birthday and you have been asked to make everyone dance at the party. You brought your best cds and you are going to make the dancefloor in fire.

You think it is easy, but as you are geek, you give yourself a constraint: all the songs you are going to play must last in total exactly 1 hour. Which songs do you choose?

## To do

Write an algorithm in ruby that pick songs from the Jukebook database to make a playlist for the party. 
The playlist you make must last exactly 1 hour!


### Bonus

* Do not play multiple songs of the same artist.
* Play at least 15 songs.
