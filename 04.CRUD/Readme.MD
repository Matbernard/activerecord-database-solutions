Since you are now an expert in SQL queries, let's have dinner to celebrate. But wait, what are going to eat ?
It could be great to have a choice of tasty recipes to prepare, right?


What about building a Cookbook database, full a delightful recipes ?

The goal of this exercice is to build a program that can create recipes and store them in a database.

We start with a simple model:

* The cookbook database contains Recipes
* A Recipe has:
	* name:string 
	* description:string 
	* length:integer (minutes) 
	* difficulty:integer 


## To do

Writes an interactive program that can create, update, read and delete recipes.

Example:

````
	Salut Robuchon, what do you want to do ?
	1. create a recipe.
	2. delete all recipes.
	3. read my recipes.
````


We prepared a skeleton of the app for you.
